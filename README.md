# MedTech

This page was made for a college project; It's **not** mobile-friendly neither responsive (yet), sorry ðŸ˜….

## Instructions

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/caiodomingues/medtech.git
$ cd medtech

$ cd frontend
$ yarn
$ yarn start

$ cd backend
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

**Note:** For the correct usage of the project, it's necessary to take a look at database connection configuration file: `ormconfig.json`.
